# Topological-Photonics-GDS-design

The respository contains Python codes that use GDSfactory to generate GDS chip design files for topological photonics lattices (both integer and anomalous quantum Hall) found in the following literature:

The file QHE lattice - grating couplers.ipynb goes through the following steps for chip design:

1. Design resonator with Euler bends:
